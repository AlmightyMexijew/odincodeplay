    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Exercise: We're going to create some stuff using JS.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Add a paragraph with red text that says "Hey I'm red!"</li>
        <li>Add an h3 with blue text that says "I'm a blue h3!"</li>
        <li>Add a div that has a black border and pink background color with the following children elements:
            <ol>
                <li>Another h1 that says "I'm in a div"</li>
                <li>A paragraph that says "ME TOO!"</li>
                <li>Hint for this one: after creating the div with createElement, append the h1 and paragraph to it before adding to the container</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <div id="testcontainer"></div>
    <script src="domindex1main.js"></script>
